        "sm_api_content": "The group of cybersecurity researchers from Keen Security Labs in China placed bright-colored stickers on the road to create a \"Fake lane\" that tricked the self-driving software of a Tesla Model S into veering from the appropriate driving lane into the opposing lane on a test course, where oncoming traffic would be driving in a real-life scenario. In a statement provided to CNBC Make It, a Tesla spokesperson pointed out that in the Keen Security Labs' tests \"The physical environment around the vehicle is artificially altered.\" The Tesla spokesperson added that the vulnerability \"Is not a realistic concern given that a driver can easily override Autopilot at any time by using the steering wheel or brakes and should always be prepared to do so, and can manually operate the windshield wiper settings at all times.\" The group of researchers, who are what is known as ethical or \"White hat\" hackers because their research is meant to improve the security of the products and companies they hack, are actually listed in Tesla's \"Security Researcher Hall of Fame\" on the electric automaker's website. In the past, Keen Security Labs has taken part in the \"Bug bounty program\" that Tesla launched in 2014, and which currently offers rewards of up to $15,000 to hackers who make Tesla aware of any potential vulnerabilities in the company's software and other products. Recently, Tesla even awarded a Model 3 car to a pair of hackers who exposed a security bug in the Tesla vehicle that allowed them to take control of the car's internal web browser.",

We do know the Corvette will be available in Saudi Arabia and perhaps China, but those countries are left-hand-drive. Whenever in 2021 the new Corvette arrives in the land Down Under, it's projected to carry a base price of around $150,000 AUD, about $102,605 USD at current exchange rates.

Investment bank Citi has also warned that \"Flight shaming\" could result in a slowdown in air travel as people look to reduce their carbon footprint. Swapping single-use plastics for a reusable cup or bottle, a metal or bamboo straw, as well as carrying a fabric bag and even a portable water purifier while travelling, is a suggestion James Thornton, CEO of adventure travel company Intrepid Travel, makes for lowering your carbon footprint. If you simply cannot avoid taking a flight due to long-haul travel, David Armstong, CEO of U.K.-based travel search platform HolidayPirates, recommends taking a direct flight as the biggest carbon emissions occur when a plane takes off and lands. Equally Thornton suggests taking the time to research which airlines or travel companies have a carbon offsetting program.",
