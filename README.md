# Smmrzr

Smmrzr is a web application that will allow a user to summarize any text composition whether that be a news article or a story.

## Why make a summarizer?
Time is of the essence to everyone. Shrinking a news article for example by 50%+ can save users minutes or hours depending on how many articles they read in any given period. Understandably, the authors and editors of a composition want their works to be read in full. Many readers, however, want a quick summary highlighting the main ideas and the conclusion of the writing.

There are also education and health benefits associated with shortening text and making the points of said text very evident.

## Design
The design of our web app should be simple and intuitive. It should also be easy on the eyes as we anticipate many people will be using it at night right before bedtime. 

The web app will start by prompting the user to sign up and login. Once this process is completed, the user can begin to use the application. The user will give the application some text or a URL and then press ‘Summarize.’ The application will print out the summary on a card like structure. When the user is finished reading the summary, there will be an option for them to summarize another piece of writing. This will start the entire process over.

## Functionality
The web app will have multiple input fields that will take in text or a URL. Signup/login procedures will be handled by the comp426-backend after we incorporate its functionality into our project. We will use the SMMRY API to summarize the given input.
